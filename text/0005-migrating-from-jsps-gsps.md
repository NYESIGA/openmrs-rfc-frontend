# Migrating from JSPs and GSPs
- Start Date: 2019/05/10
- RFC PR: https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-rfc-frontend/pull/5

## Decision, including impact on distributions
Existing server rendered pages, including JSPs, GSPs,
[the reference application](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-referenceapplication), and
[legacyui](https://github.com/openmrs/openmrs-module-legacyui) will be migrated away from, with
the following migration path:

1) Distributions that use server rendered JSPs/GSPs will link to
[the OpenMRS SPA]()

## Definition
Define terms here and explain what the "how does this apply to distributions" decision means.

## Reason for decision
- Bullet points that explain things.
- It's good to link to things, too, if there are relevant things.

## Alternatives
Explaining the alternatives gives nuance to the decision and shows we considered more than one option.

## Common practices (not enforced)
- A chance to give some comments on popular practices used for OpenMRS and its distributions.
- A chance to opine on some things related to this.
